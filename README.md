This crate provides [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) bindings for Rust. Currently, only Linux is supported.

## How to Use

1. Add `nginx` crate to Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
nginx = "0.4"
```

**Note:** In order to build the crate, `clang` must be installed and the following command must be executed on the host:

```sh
sed -i 's:# define IPPORT_RESERVED:// #define IPPORT_RESERVED:' /usr/include/netdb.h
```

## Build

It is recommended to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) to build the crate:

```sh
make build-image
make build
```

**Note:** The version of Nginx could be set using `NGINX_VERSION` environment variable, if it is not set, the default version is used:

```sh
NGINX_VERSION=1.15.8 cargo build
```

Some code were copied (and refactored) from [nginxinc/ngx-rust](https://github.com/nginxinc/ngx-rust).
